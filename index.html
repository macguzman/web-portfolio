      <p class="intro">After spending a few years in college and not knowing what I want to do, I was lost and in need of finding something that I could enjoy. That's when my brother-in-law introduced me to coding. He showed me what he was currently doing for one of his bootcamps and I was immediatley intrigued of how complex and fufilling it was. I then went home myself and started researching it myself, finding out that I could become a software developer in under a year and have really good job too made me take the risk. I then became a student of Thinkful in the Developer bootcamp with my brother.</p> 
      <strong class="intro">Some of my hobbies are:</strong>
      <ul class="intro">
        <li>I have two gorgeous daughters</li>
        <li>Collecting clothes, sneakers, and boots. Basically anthing fashion I love</li>
        <li>Videogames is a must. I don't really go out much like I used to but playing games lets me stay connected with my friends and family</li>
      </ul>
      <!--Using ul here gives us an unordered list and li is adding to the list as you can see each of the li give a bulletpoint-->
